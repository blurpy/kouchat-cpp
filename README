KouChat C++
===========


This version of KouChat is written in C++, using the Qt4 framework. You need Qt4 and gcc/g++ to compile the source code.
This is something I wrote while learning to program C++ in school, and is based on an old version of KouChat in Java.

Note: the application is in Norwegian.


Steps to compile on Windows:
1. Download Qt4 for Windows with MinGW (gcc for Windows) from http://qt-project.org/
2. Download and install the Windows Platform SDK (not .NET).
3. Clone the KouChat source code to a folder.
4. Edit 'src.pro' in the src folder so win32:LIBS has the correct path to the Platform SDK.
5. Start Qt 4.x.x Command Prompt from the start menu.
6. Navigate to the src folder using the command prompt.
7. Run 'qmake'
8. Run 'make'
9. Copy 'mingwm10.dll', 'QtCore4.dll', 'QtGui4.dll', 'QtNetwork4.dll' and 'QtXml4.dll' to the root folder where kouchat.exe is. You can find those files in the bin folder where you installed Qt4.
10. Done! You can start the application using kouchat.exe. You can safely delete the src folder.
Note: The steps have not been verified on Windows since 2007.

Steps to compile on Linux:
1. Install Qt4 and gcc/g++ using your distribution's package manager.
2. Clone the KouChat source code to a folder.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Navigate to the src folder using the terminal.
5. Run 'qmake'
6. Run 'make'
7. Done! You can start the application using the kouchat binary. You can safely delete the src folder. You can use bilder/kou_normal.png as a shortcut icon.

Steps to compile on Mac:
1. Probably something like the Windows or Linux method.

Qt Creator can also be used, as a more graphical build tool. It knows what to do with the source code.
Just remember to set the working directory to the root of the project, or KouChat wont find any resources.
